        ## Hotfix Request

        Hotfixes are for **urgent production issues** that need immediate attention.

        ### Important Guidelines:

        - **Always create a Bug issue first** (even for emergencies) to maintain traceability
        - Reference the Bug issue number below
        - A hotfix branch will be created from the parent Bug branch
        - For production emergencies without an existing Bug branch, the workflow will use `main` as a fallback

        ### Workflow:

        1. Create a Bug issue (if one doesn't exist)
        2. Create this Hotfix issue referencing the Bug issue
        3. Work on the auto-generated `hotfix/` branch
        4. Merge the hotfix PR to fix the bug quickly
        5. Version bumps with a letter suffix (e.g., `0.1.2.1a`)

        **Required**: The issue number of the Bug this hotfix addresses (e.g., 42).
        Enter numbers only, without the # symbol.

        **Note**: Even for emergency hotfixes, create a Bug issue first to document the problem.
        This maintains full traceability and helps prevent similar issues in the future.

        **Emergency fallback**: If you absolutely cannot create a Bug issue first (production is down),
        the workflow will use `main` as the parent branch, but you should create a Bug issue
        immediately after for documentation purposes.

        ## Issue
        Production authentication endpoint returning 500 errors for 20% of users

        ## Impact
        - Approximately 500 users cannot log in
        - Started 30 minutes ago

        ## Root Cause
        Null pointer exception in token validation

        ## Proposed Fix
        Add null check before token validation

        ## Temporary Workaround
        Users can use "forgot password" flow as alternative
